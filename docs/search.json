Event planning becomes even harder in the university setting as there are various groups and organizations that have to go through several departments to receive approvals for execution. I built an SQL based database system to introduce a convenient system for users to plan events, manage expenses, budgets, and many other crucial aspects of event organization."

    "text": "Exploration of Spatially Specific Mentions in Narrative Text for Spatial Video Geonarratives\nThrough this project, I aimed to capture spatially specific mentions and comments related to needle use or drug-related objects by tracking investigators or participants as they identify or point to such items. This approach is based on research utilizing Spatial Video Geonarratives (SVG), a methodology in nursing research that leverages wearable cameras and GPS technology. SVG allows for the detailed study of needle debris in the environment, particularly in the context of homelessness and drug use, helping to inform public health strategies aimed at addressing these issues."
